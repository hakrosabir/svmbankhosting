        <div class="question">3. Will SVM Bank customers have access to First Citizens Bank products and services, including branches and ATMs?</div>
        <div class="answer">At this time, SVM Bank customers will not have access to First Citizens Bank products and services, including branches and ATMs. SVM Bank customers should continue to bank and access their accounts as they always have.</div>

        <div class="question">4. Is First Citizens Bank committed to supporting the innovation and technology sectors?</div>

        <div class="question">5. Will First Citizens continue to invest in SVM Bank’s Global Fund Banking business?</div>
        <div class="answer">SVM Bank’s large portfolio of client relationships across private equity and venture capital firms and their portfolio companies nicely complements First Citizens’ existing customer base. We recognize the importance of legacy SVM’s Global Fund Banking business in providing banking, payments, FX and capital call lines to private equity and venture capital clients as well as deposit products, treasury management products and several FX solutions to facilitate cross-border capital flows for private equity/venture capital clients. We are committed to building on and investing in SVM Bank’s Global Fund Banking business to preserve these strong relationships and serve as their leading provider of banking, payments, FX and capital call lines.</div>

        <div class="question">6. What is the status of SVM Bank’s products and solutions?</div>
        <div class="answer">In SVM Bank’s commercial bank and private bank, we have all the products we had before, except for Cayman DDA/MMA accounts and Eurodollar Sweep products. This includes SVM Asset Management, Foreign Exchange and Community Development Finance among all of our online banking, cash management, deposit products and credit solutions (including venture debt, term loans, syndicated loans, revenue-based financing, mezzanine financing, etc.). FX wires are back up and running.</div>

        <div class="question">7. Why should we consider staying with SVM Bank?</div>
        <div class="answer">SVM Bank is open and here to serve you as we always have – focused and specialized in the innovation economy. As a division of First Citizens, SVM Bank is running as SVM, and our clients do not need to change anything to receive the services they know and expect from the team with the deepest bench of innovation economy expertise and a team that serves the innovation economy better than any other financial institution. What our clients in every sector, segment and life stage of the innovation economy need and expect from SVM Bank is still here – dedicated and knowledgeable teams, comprehensive products and services, exceptional service and a deep understanding of our clients’ unique businesses.
